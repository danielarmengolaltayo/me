**Design your own life.**

We are not predefined static beings. People can change. In fact, we are constantly changing, depending on the experiences we are exposed to and how we process them.

We can shape our experiences to some extent, but there is always a set of variables out of our control. However, we can learn and train our ability to deal with what is happening to us. Changing our way to think and perceive the world is the first step, but not the last one. Our actions are deeply rooted in previous mental constructions, and it is only through direct experience, by doing and living, that we can slowly evolve from old paradigms to new ones. How we behave consolidates who we are.

Behaviour must be coherent with my beliefs if I want to be honest with myself. That is why I think that an active and constant exercise of readjusting what I think and say with what I do is key. And because some changes require more effort than others and time is a scarce resource, I am trying to find ways that help me out to be more efficient and effective.

I understand life as a gift, as a beautiful opportunity the universe delivered to us. Not living it fully, with love and respect to any other life form would be an irresponsible act and a sad waste.
