# Conversation with myself

This is a personal exercice to find clarity, a conversation with myself. I am using this medium because it is mutable and at the same time practical to me, and because it is open, exposing myself to ideas and thoughts from others. 

The conversation will cover different topics organized in separate drafts. At this stage, I want to prioritize quantity over quality. Sorry in advance for the mess.

→ [Manifesto](manifesto.md). The foundations for my story.

→ Collection of [systems](systems.md), techniques, tools, skills, rules, strategies, ideas, tricks and hacks **designed to model my own behavior**.

→ Essays on random thoughts:
- Your reality is built upon the [perspective](perspective.md) you choose to take.
- Everything outside you acts as a [mirror](mirrors.md) for yourself.
