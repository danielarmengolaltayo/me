# Conversation with myself

This is a personal exercise to find clarity, a conversation with myself <sup>[1]</sup>. I am using this medium because it is mutable and at the same time practical to me, and because it is open, exposing myself to ideas and thoughts from others. 

→ Personal statement and commitment:
- Introduction and context
    - The internet is a living [collective portrait](internet-collective-portrait.md) of humanity.
    - We need complex technology to cope with [complexity](complex-technology.md).
    - The internet [is not the same](differences-internet-web.md) as the web.
- The design of the Web
    - We browse the web, jumping from page to page [using links](browse-the-web-using-links.md) as portals.
    - *(ongoing)*

→ General thoughts:
- [Design your own behavior](design-life.md) to influence the course of your life.
- Our [perception of reality](perception-of-reality.md) is just a story.
- Your reality is built upon the [perspective](perspective.md) you choose to take.
- Everything outside of you acts as a [mirror](mirrors.md) from which to observe yourself.

→ Thinking by doing:
- [Pay-Per-Follow](pay-per-follow.md)
