# Design your own life. Why?

We are not predefined static beings. **People can change**. In fact, we are  constantly changing, depending on the experiences we are exposed to and how we process them.

We can shape our experiences to some extent, but there is always a set of variables out of our control. However, we can learn and train our ability to deal with what is happening to us. Changing our way to think and perceive the world is the first step, but not the last one. Our actions are deeply rooted in previous mental constructions, and it is only through direct experience, by doing and living, that we can slowly evolve from old paradigms to new ones. **How we behave consolidates who we are**.

Behaviour must be coherent with my beliefs if I want to be honest with myself. That is why I think that an active and constant exercise of readjusting what I think and say with what I do is key. And because some changes require more effort than others and time is a scarce resource, **I am trying to find ways that help me out to be more efficient and effective**.

I understand life as a gift, as a beautiful opportunity the universe delivered to us. Not living it fully, with love and respect to any other life form would be an irresponsible act and a sad waste.

# System X (?): manage movement

This system is about managing time and attention (described as the allocation of limited cognitive processing resources) in order to generate movement, to transform action into visible results.

## Structure

1. üîÆ **Plan** for the future(s).
2. üî• **Do** now. Actions in the present moment. Focus.
3. üìã **Review** the past and evaluate its results. What did you learn?
4. üóÑ **Record** the recent experiences in an organized way to easy retreive them later.
5. üîã **Rest** to get ready for the next cycle. Breaks.
6. ‚ôªÔ∏è **Repeat** the cycle. Create the habit.

## Notes

- Plan, do and review are the main part of the system. We usually focus on doing. Planning comes next, and review it is often the last one.
- Record, rest and repeat are the parts responsible to maintain the system. We rarely record what we do.
- Plan is about decision, goals, deadlines...
- Without clear goals in mind (short-term or long-term goals, vision or mission in life) it is difficult to maintain the focus on something, and easy to fall into imposed urgent tasks rather the ones that we consider important.
- When reviewing/recording (?) a past experience, we can share it to collect feedback.
- Add experiences to your personal archive vs collective archive.
- Alternate names for record: organize, sort, archive, catalog, log, collect
- Process of cleaning during record.
- Repetition of the cycle daily vs weekly vs ?. Whan does it changes?
    - Use of the calendar to gain perspective.
    - Steps (very similar?)
        1. Define goals
        2. Assign tasks
        3. Review and evaluate
        4. Iterate
- During review and record, knowledge and memory consolidate.
- Any system requires trust and commitment in order to be validated.
- To be focused on doing what you want to do is only possible if first you know what you want to do (plan).
- It is not about committing blindly to follow just one exercise, is about making all the exercises work well together in harmony, and in consonance with your day to day life.

## Subsystems

1. Plan
    - to-do list + a4
    - airtable calendar
    - goals / ly system?
2. Do
    - tracking time + time management
        - possible names: god, to-day, now, cache, boss, focus, obey
        - rules
            - work using time blocks and don't drag a bad management of time from one block to the next one
            - dedicate the first minutes of the time block to check the tasks for the block
3. Review
    - review system (rewards)
4. Record
    - organization system (files? IPMM?)
5. Rest?
6. Repeat
    - track habits / commitment
    - peer pressure sessions

# System X (?): plan

## Airtable (or any tool to manage tasks)

1. ‚ú® **Add** tasks accumulated on paper during the day
    - Using a form to facilitate the entry of new tasks.
2. ‚ùå **Delete** tasks done
    - Easy process, almost automatic if tasks are well organized from the day before
3. üëÅ **Check** the other tasks and delete or modify (content, priority, date...) if necessary
    - The most boring and less urgent step to do, but equally important. Right now there is a lot of friction here, the system gets cluttered easily making more difficult the process.
4. ‚úÖ **Select** tasks to do tomorrow
    - Implies decision.
5. ‚è∞ **Assign** tasks to time blocks
    - Requires to have the time blocks for the day well defined. I am exploring the benefits of dividing the day in blocks.

## Paper (A4)

1. üóì **Day code** YYMMDD
    - for quick reference for other processes where I need also the code
    - to keep papers organized in the case that I have more than one paper around at the same time
2. üç∞ **Divide by blocks** of time
3. ‚úçüèª **Move the list** of tasks from Airtable to paper
4. üìä **Add est. time per task** in blocks that require extra productivity and check that the sum of all estimations equals the total available time for the block
5. üìé **Transfer notes** from previous paper if there is any
6. üóë **Throw the previous paper away** (or recycle it)

## Notes

- Can I create a tool that acts as an assistant, guiding me across all the steps?
    - Integrate with "god"?
    - screen, paper, interactive...
        - an interactive version could allow me to track time for each task or step in order to accumulate data for further iterations

            - responsive version?
    - The same assistant could track the rest of things I am tracking right now, e.g. food intake
    - How can I interact or modify the steps on the fly?
