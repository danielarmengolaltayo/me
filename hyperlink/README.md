- **Preface**
    - [Why I wrote this text](preface-link.md), how to read it and why you might be interested in exploring its content.
- **Introduction**
    - The Internet is a living [collective portrait](internet-collective-portrait.md) of humanity.
    - We need complex technology to cope with [complexity](complex-technology.md).
    - The Internet [is not the same](differences-internet-web.md) as the Web.
- **The design of the Web**
    - We browse the Web, jumping from page to page [using links](browse-the-web-using-links.md) as portals.
    - [Links are pointers](links-are-pointers.md), not connectors. Links are unidirectional by design.
    - True connections on the web require [extra effort](true-connections-web.md).
- **Consequences**
    - [Platforms manage connections for you](platforms-manage-connections.md). Some of these platforms rule the world today.
    - [Platforms need your attention](platforms-need-attention.md) because they want you to create more connections to manage.
- **Conclusion**
    - The Web established the rules for a [game of inequality](game-of-inequality.md) that platforms learned to master.
    - Unidirectionality of links is [a major flaw](unidirectionality-of-links.md) in the design of the Web.
- **My response**
    - I am here to participate in a collective effort to [upgrade the Web](upgrade-the-web.md).
    - How to [get in touch and follow](contact-and-follow.md) the progress of the project.
