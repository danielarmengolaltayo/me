# The Hyperlink Delusion

**13 min read in total** <sup>[1]</sup>

*This text is presented in a particular format. It is divided into small capsules to allow a different approach for both the writer <sup>[2]</sup> and the reader. You can get a complete overview of the content in less than a minute by just reading the outline below. External links and footnotes are complementary, not required to understand the content. Each capsule is written to work as a self-contained piece, which means you can read it independently although a sequential narrative is suggested. From there, explore as you please. Enjoy the reading.*

- **Preface**
    - [Why I wrote this text](preface-link.md) and why you might be interested in reading it.
- **Introduction**
    - The Internet is a living [collective portrait](internet-collective-portrait.md) of humanity.
    - We need complex technology to cope with [complexity](complex-technology.md).
    - The Internet [is not the same](differences-internet-web.md) as the Web.
- **The design of the Web**
    - We browse the Web, jumping from page to page [using links](browse-the-web-using-links.md) as portals.
    - [Links are pointers](links-are-pointers.md), not connectors. Links are unidirectional by design.
    - True connections on the web require [extra effort](true-connections-web.md).
- **Consequences**
    - [Platforms manage connections for you](platforms-manage-connections.md). Some of these platforms rule the world today.
    - [Platforms need your attention](platforms-need-attention.md) because they want you to create more connections to manage.
- **Conclusion**
    - The Web established the rules for a [game of inequality](game-of-inequality.md) that platforms learned to master.
    - Unidirectionality of links is [a major flaw](unidirectionality-of-links.md) in the design of the Web.
- **My response**
    - I am here to participate in a collective effort to [upgrade the Web](upgrade-the-web.md).
    - How to [get in touch and follow](contact-and-follow.md) the progress of the project.

[2] Right now, this text is living in a context that allows change. I am taking advantage of it, adding more references post scriptum, making examples more clear, correcting grammar mistakes or even leaving notes to myself while maintaining a readable and comprehensible narrative. Please, if you find a typo, know about other perspectives or have a better way to illustrate an idea, contribute via GitHub or send me an email (contact details inside the last capsule). Thank you!
