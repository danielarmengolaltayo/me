I observe the world around us, and I see suffering, the same way I suffer too.

We all suffer and suffering comes in many forms and intensities. We are afraid of uncertainty and uncertainty is always one step ahead of us, but at the same time, we are delighted by pleasure, happiness and love.

All these emotions, transformed into sensations that run through our bodies, are temporary states. We dance from one state to another, staying more here, jumping gracefully there. And there is a lot of difference in these sensations depending on how we decide to dance, on how we define our particular dance style, our unique sensitivity to comprehend the world and relate with the others.

We dance and dance, but we need time and effort to catch the rhythm so we can feel comfortable on the dancefloor. Step by step our movements become more natural to us and in each swing our body gain inertia and confidence, and the more we dance, the more established our style is. 

But we have to keep in mind that we can always decide another set of dance moves, that we can decide at any time how to react to the rhythms that life chooses to play for us, because what is certain is that the future is uncertain, and our mindset has to be ready to improvise, to adapt. We humans are very good at it, we are flexible, we are not static, predetermined beings. We change as much as everything changes around us, and we have agency in this constant flow of changes.

**Your reality is built upon the perspective you choose to take**.

Don't be afraid, don't let fear speak in your name.

Please, do not get stuck in a dance style.
