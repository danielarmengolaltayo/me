## Why I wrote this text, how to read it and why you might be interested in exploring its content.

Hello, my name is Daniel and this is my attempt to explain what I decided to focus my attention on and why I think it is important that we do something about it. It is my way to state my commitment, part of a collective effort to improve how we relate to each other, as a subset of how we relate to life and the environment.

Our behavior is modulated by the result of our interactions, and because we are social beings, our relationships with others influence our behavior, the same way we influence the behavior of others with our actions. Moreover, how we relate with others is determined by our ability to convey meanings, needs and perceptions, and this is why good communication is key in our society

Since we inhabit the whole planet, it is important to approach communication at such a planetary scale. The internet allows us to do that and the web is one of the best mechanisms we have today for global communication. But there is still much to learn and improve.

I want to inspire others in the same way that others inspire me. I have chosen my playground and I am eager to find more people to play with. This writing is my introduction, but also an open call to join in. Maybe you are already playing, maybe you are also willing to participate in the game, in any case, see you there ;-)
