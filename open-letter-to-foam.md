# Open letter to Foam 

*Hello, my name is Daniel, and after personally using the tool intensively for a few months, I have come to the conclusion that **the potential that Foam offers go beyond what is communicated or considered**.*

*It is not the intention of this text to go into too much detail, simply to draw a line of thought to open a conversation.*

***I would love to hear your opinion.***

## Our relationship with the digital medium is mediated by two major interfaces

We relate to digital information in two contexts, local and online, and for each of these contexts we have an interface that mediates between us and the information.

In the local context, the interface is the operating system of the device, in the online context, it is the browser. In both cases, there are open source alternatives, but in general, modifying systems of this size to adapt them to very specific needs is not worth the effort.

The usual formula is to build on top. Applications for operating systems, extensions for browsers, and from the user's POV, those applications or extensions can sometimes be slightly adjusted or customized.

But, **what happens when individual needs conflict with the paradigms established by the systems that support our relationship with the digital medium?**

For example, for the OS we have the metaphor of the desktop that imposes a hierarchical structure of information on us, and it is difficult for it to conceive that the same file may want to exist in two different locations.

When we are online, browsing the web, we can jump from page to page using links, but we can only go in one direction since we do not know what other pages are pointing where we are.

We can see some tools for thought challenging these designs by structuring information in graphs and implementing bidirectional links, but their scope is limited to the creation and management of notes.

## Foam proposes a change on the rules of the game

Foam's strategy: repurpose VSCode, a tool designed for programming, transformed into a tool for taking notes.

Building on top of an existing system has its advantages, but we must take into account and also evaluate its disadvantages since we run the risk of falling into hidden traps or generating unnecessary dependencies. It does not have to be a bad strategy, but it's important to be clear about the needs and objectives.

Foam currently follows a formula based on ‚Äúrecipes‚Äù. Depending on what you want to eat, you prepare one or the other, and if you do not find what you are looking for, you can create your own.

My set of recipes not only allows me to manage my notes, but I also use it to interact with the rest of the files stored on my computer, replacing, to a certain extent, my experience with the OS file system. My idea is to add more recipes in order to interact, for example, with the browser, to exchange messages with other people, or to work on the same notes together.

I do not imagine **Foam** as a substitute for the file system or the browser, but **as a layer closer to me that can operate under my terms and conditions**.

## A new way of relating to digital information

IMO, Foam is playing with a combination of pieces (principles, values, intentions, formats, uses ...) that can take it far beyond a simple framework or note-taking application. Yes, it does the job of a tool for thought, but I think that the "second brain" metaphor can be confusing and constraining.

**It is offering us the possibility of making decisions** about how to relate to information in a digital context. Decisions that until now were very far from the end-user. Decisions **that allow us to rethink how we want to relate to others or to ourselves** since this digital context and the information it contains is nothing more than a reflection of ourselves and the society in which we live.

<br>

## A new way of conceiving

We are information processing machines. We perceive reality through our senses and transform it into a conception of the world that is useful to us for our survival. We collect information, process it, and act on it. That is why information technologies play a key role in our evolution as a species.

The possibility of managing information differently influences the configuration of our mental models, affecting our behaviors, our way of interacting with our surroundings, how we generate new information, and ultimately altering the balance points of a network of interdependencies, a network formed by all the entities that coexist on this planet.

I think that little by little we are beginning to understand what it means and what it implies to be a digital society, and it seems to me that Foam, without being fully aware of it, wants to accompany us on that journey.

<br>

## But what are these new ways?

I know that Foam does not exist in isolation, that it is part of an ecosystem, that there are similar projects and initiatives and many other people working in the same direction. I wonder exactly what that direction is, what all these proposals are looking for, how they are doing it, and why.

I don't know, maybe with a little coordination, we can identify and rethink those self-destructive dynamics to transform them into healthier and more beneficial synergies for both the individual and the collective.
