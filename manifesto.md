# Write your own manifesto. Why?

As humans, we need to make sense of reality. This need is embedded in our nature, and the means we have to make sense out of it is through stories. Our perception of reality is just a story, formed by a collection of concepts and ideas that seem to be reasonable enough to satisfy our mind. 

What I am doing here is to play with random thoughts that are bouncing inside my head, trying to connect them in a way that helps me to better understand my story.

# Manifesto

This manifesto will never ever be finished.
