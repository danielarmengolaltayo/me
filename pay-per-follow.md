# Pay-Per-Follow

![pay-per-follow image](pay-per-follow.jpg)

*Pay-Per-Follow* is a [reperformance](https://www.nytimes.com/video/multimedia/100000002717833/timestalks-marina-abramovic-part-8.html) of [Follow](http://armengol-altayo.com/#follow), by [Daniel Armengol Altay√≥](armengol-altayo.com).

From March 24 to May 13, 2018, for six days per week, around seven hours and a half per day, Daniel was¬†following the movements of the audience in a delimited space, using a VR headset and two controllers.¬†In this free exhibition, people make him move more than 4,800 times, at an average of 1:00 min each interaction.

*Pay-Per-Follow* is a partnership between [Kai Corvus](kaicorvus.com) and Daniel to bring the experience back, shifting the context to extend the conversation and ask new questions.

[A black market for selling internet-ish things](http://yami-ichi.biz/) was the context and the setup consisted of two performers, one forced to connect with the public, the other inviting people to connect. The proposal: 1,00 eur x 1:00 min. Pay one euro to control a person for one minute.

When the countdown of sixty seconds finished, after paying to control a person and indeed controlled one of the performers for one minute, the participant is paid back the same euro by the second performer and faced with the question, ‚Äúhow much would you be willing to pay to have control over another person?‚Äù, and the options ‚Äúa) less than one euro, b) one euro, c) more than one euro‚Äù to gave a response and act accordingly.

The performance is divided in two acts. First, naively seduce the public to cash one euro out from their pockets, and then, confront anyone who took part with an uncomfortable truth.

In the same way [that Amazon may withdraw one euro from your bank account to give it back to you later as a measure to confirm the validity of your payment card](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201895660), the transaction happening in the performance directs the attention of the public and the tone for the subsequent conversation. *Pay-Per-Follow* is about money as a medium to exchange value from one person to another and its power over people.

At what price would you let them control you? Are you aware of the value of your actions?
