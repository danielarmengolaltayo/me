**Everything outside of you acts as a mirror from which to observe yourself.**

All you perceive as reality can be used to project your image on it. On glass walls, in a puddle of water on a sidewalk or inside of a spoon. Material reality. Tangible but also intangible. Virtual too.

From [the avatar you choose in a videogame](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w80Q9PhWheI&t=58) to the digital persona you construct in each and every platform. Start with a profile picture. Add a short bio. Maybe some emojis here and there. Then a photo, its caption, the location, tag-tag-tag... don't forget to mention, to comment, to like. 

Follow, refresh, swipe. Swipe, refresh, unfollow. 

Double check. Save for later. Report. DM. Match.

The others. They act also as avatars for you. Constantly and endlessly performing for you, as vivid representations of what you might be or what you do not want to be. [Living simulations of your projected self](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l80zgw07W4Y&t=140s).

A conversation? Feedback. The better somebody is listening to you, the better is [the bouncing back](https://youtu.be/f0Fi32LbXHA?t=1303) of your emotions. 

A yawn. [An unexpected smile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Th0aOoX4EM&t=205s). A close look to another face and you will see your shadow moving inside the black of the eyes <sup>[1]</sup>.

> "You don’t need me. What you really need is a mirror. Because any stranger is for you simply a mirror in which to reflect yourself." — Kōbō Abe, The Face of Another

The wind blowing in response to your silent inner thoughts. Good weather, good mood. Bad mood, bad weather. The intimacy of the shooting star or the flash of a lightning. The warmth of sunlight hugging your naked body when you feel at peace.

The animals that talk to you and how you talk to them.

What you eat. What you breathe. What you buy. What you do. What you click.

That movie last night. The podcast on the train. Those books you will never start, and those you will never finish. What you have in front of you right now. Not only these words but the medium, the channel through which you got access to them.

> "The internet is a reflection of our society and that mirror is going to be reflecting what we see. If we do not like what we see in that mirror the problem is not to fix the mirror, we have to fix society." — Vint Cerf

You can try. Turn this screen off for a sec, maybe you can see yourself reflected in there too.

[1] "In a surprising number of unrelated languages, the etymological meaning of the term for pupil is "little person". This is true, for example, of the word pupil itself: this comes into English from Latin pūpilla, which means "doll, girl", and is a diminutive form of pupa, "girl". (The double meaning in Latin is preserved in English, where pupil means both "schoolchild" and "dark central portion of the eye within the iris".) This may be because the reflection of one's image in the pupil is a minuscule version of one's self." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pupil
