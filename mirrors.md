**Everything outside you acts as a mirror for yourself.**

From the avatar you choose in a videogame to the digital persona you construct in each and every platform. Start with a profile picture. Add a short bio. Maybe some emojis here and there. Then a photo, its caption, the location, tag-tag-tag... don't forget to mention, to comment, to like. 

Follow, refresh, swipe. Swipe, refresh, unfollow. 

Double check. Save for later. Report. DM. Match.

The others. 

They act also as avatars for you. Constantly and endlessly performing for you, as vivid representations of what you might be or what you do not want to be. Living simulations of your projected self.

A conversation? Feedback. The better somebody is listening to you, the better is [the bouncing back](https://youtu.be/f0Fi32LbXHA?t=1303) of your emotions. 

A yawn. An unexpected smile. A close look to another face and you will see your shadow moving inside the black of the eyes.

> "You don’t need me. What you really need is a mirror. Because any stranger is for you simply a mirror in which to reflect yourself." — Kōbō Abe, The Face of Another

The wind blowing in response to your silent inner thoughts. Good weather, good mood. Bad mood, bad weather. The intimacy of the shooting star or the flash of a lightning. The warmth of sunlight hugging your naked body when you feel at peace.

The animals that talk to you and how you talk to them.

What you eat. What you breathe. What you buy. What you do. 

That movie last night. The podcast on the train. Those books you will never start, and those you will never finish. This messy words you are reading right now.

This screen. Turn it off and you will see yourself reflected there too.
