## The internet is not the same as the web.

It's very common to use the terms of the Internet and the Web as synonyms without caring too much about the differences or the exact meaning. Depending on the context it's not a big deal, but because with this text I want you to pay attention particularly to one of them, the Web, I am going to go over the main differences really fast to be sure we are in the same page before we explore the topic further <sup>[1][2]</sup>.

- The Internet is infrastructure, more specifically, information infrastructure. The Web is a system running on top of this infrastructure <sup>[3][4]</sup>, like the email, for example.

- We use the Internet with the objective to improve communication between humans and we use the Web as a non-physical place where we actually meet to communicate and coordinate with others <sup>[5]</sup>. 

- The Internet links physical devices worldwide, **the Web connects pieces of information with other pieces of information**.

Blogs, social media sites, email groups, discussion boards, forumsâ€”they're all the same thing: virtual scenes where people go to hang out and talk about the things they care about."
