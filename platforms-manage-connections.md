## Platforms manage connections for you. Some of these platforms rule the world today.

Suppose we both have a personal webpage and we want it to show that we are friends. In my page I make reference to yours and you do the same towards mine. We want to establish a connection that explains publicly our friendship relationship.

To keep this connection active and up to date on our respective sites, some degree of maintenance is mandatory. If we don't want to do it ourselves, a platform could take over. From social networks to search engines, online marketplaces and everything in between.

*I need this item, maybe I'll buy it later. Store it in my wishlist. Share it with my friends. Send a DM. Message read but not replied. Block this user. Follow this other one. Like this photo. Tag this photo. I like cats too, join this group. Search for it. Show me the newsfeed of this account. Watch this video. Write a comment. Upvote this other comment. Click that ad. Maybe I need this item too.*

All types of platforms for all types of connections. 

What these platforms offer, most of the time for free <sup>[1]</sup>, is maintenance for your connections and the opportunity to create new ones when using their service.

Apparently, the deal seems all advantages for the user and it is undeniable that many of these platforms really contribute to improve our daily lives. But we must understand and be aware that **by delegating the responsibility in the management of our connections we are losing power over them**. At the individual level, the power granted is almost imperceptible, but at the scale that these companies operate, the accumulated power is immense <sup>[2][3]</sup>.

More users means potential for more connections. To more connections, more power. The more power, the more capability to impact society, for better or for worse.

[3] "In my view, **a lot of the Silicon Valley world that's arisen since the turn of the century has essentially created gigantic fortunes trying to reconstruct the backlinks that were lost**. For instance, if there were two-way links and everything knew what was pointing at it, all you'd have to do is count up all those things and find where there are the most links and you have Google. The information would be right there and it would be public, but because all that was thrown away, Google had to scrape the whole internet or the whole web every night and calculate the backlinks that might have been there and count up where the most of them where in order to sell it to people as a service, to advertisers in this case. [...] Facebook is another one. If you had two-way links you'd know who was interested in what you are doing, you'd meet them. [...] If you look at the big Silicon Valley success stories they are essentially privatizing the gap between what Tim did and what Ted knew needed to be done from decades earlier and that particular gap filling has created the fastest biggest fortunes in history. Isn't that astonishing?" Jaron Lanier's tribute to Ted Nelson at the "Intertwingled" conference.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5i6LXdj_Z6s (17:57)
